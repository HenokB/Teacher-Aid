## How to run the project?
## 1. Using Docker 🐳 (Only Client Side)

### 📌 Pre-requisites
- docker
- docker-compose (which usually comes along with docker but if it's not the case then yeah)

### 📌 Steps 
- Clone the repository using git clone 
```https://github.com/HenokB/Teacher-Aid.git``` 
- Navigate to the client `cd client`
- Create an empty firebase project and get all the keys and add them in the `firebase.js` file.
- Run `docker-compose up`
- Now it will start running and you can go to http://localhost:3000/ from your browser and it would render dev tools in your browser.


## 2 Using NPM or YARN 📦


- `git clone https://github.com/HenokB/Teacher-Aid.git`

- navigate to the client folder using `cd client`

- Create an empty firebase project and get all the keys and add them in the `firebase.js` file.

- run `npm start`, it will start running and you can go to http://localhost:3000/


## For the backend🔌

1. Make sure you are in the root directory.
2. Go to `cohere.ai` and get an API key. Put it inside the `server/index.js` file.
2. Install all the dependencies using `yarn install` or `npm i`
3. Run `npm start` or `yarn start` in the root dir. This will launch the backend in `localhost:3001`

#### ⚠️ Don't forget to Run both the client and server at the same time in two different terminals.
