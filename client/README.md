# To get started with the frontend, you can use two ways

## 1. Using Docker 🐳

### 📌 Pre-requisites
- docker
- docker-compose (which usually comes along with docker but if it's not the case then yeah)

### 📌 Steps 
- Clone the repository using git clone 
```https://github.com/HenokB/Teacher-Aid.git``` 
- Run `docker-compose up`
- Now it will start running and you can go to http://localhost:3000/ from your browser and it would render dev tools in your browser

## 2 Using NPM or YARN


### 1. `git clone https://github.com/HenokB/Teacher-Aid.git`

### 2. navigate to the client folder using `cd client`

### 3. run `npm start`


Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
